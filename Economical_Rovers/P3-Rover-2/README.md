# Rover 1

## Wiring

Here is an overveiw of how the Arduino/Redboard is wired using the motor driver provided in the parts list below.

For a more detailed description of how to wire the redboard you can refer to page 96 of the ["SparkFun Inventor's Kit"](https://github.com/P3-NSF-NRT/P3_Corteva-Phenome2020-Workshop/blob/master/SIK%20v4.1%20Book%202019%20WEB.pdf) manual or the [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) website.

## Code

The code used for this rover is mainly provided by the example code provided with the Inventor Kit. There are a few areas that the code was modified to better fit our use and design.

**Note:** Code mentioned here is used with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) which can be used online or through a program downloaded to a computer. **This is not Python or R code, it is Arduino IDE code**

## Body

This rover had a very simplistic design because it is intended for demenstration more than use. The main body is made out of poster board and the two tires attached to the motors are listed below. The front tire is a caster wheel picked up from the local hardware store. The reason it has a three wheel design is because having a front fixed axil prevents the car from turning, to have a four wheel design one would need to make a front axil that turns. This is explored more in [Rover 3](../P3-Rover-3).
