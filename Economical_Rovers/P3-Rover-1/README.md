For a more detailed description of how to wire the redboard you can refer to page 96 of the ["SparkFun Inventor's Kit"](https://github.com/P3-NSF-NRT/P3_Corteva-Phenome2020-Workshop/blob/master/SIK%20v4.1%20Book%202019%20WEB.pdf) manual or the [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) website.

## Code

The code used for this rover is mainly provided by the example code provided with the Inventor Kit. There are a few areas that the code was modified to better fit our use and design.

**Note:** Code mentioned here is used with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) which can be used online or through a program downloaded to a computer. **This is not Python or R code, it is Arduino IDE code**
