# Economical Rovers

This section of workshop is focused on the use of rovers assembled using resources that can be obtained at relatively low-cost. Below you will find three different sections covering the different types of rovers that were on display at the workshop. The first section is for the smaller rover that was fed commands from a computer and then executed those commands. The second section covers the rover that had code uploaded and could execute a pre-planned path when supplied with battery power. The final section is a more advanced rover that is controlled from a controller wirelessly and has a more complex set up.
