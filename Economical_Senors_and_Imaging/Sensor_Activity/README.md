# Sensor Activity

This section compiles all of the necessary resources to recreate the Arduino 
demonstrations at the Phenome 2020 Conference by Corteva.

## Hardware
Listed below are the Arduino components used for our demonstration. There are many different models/flavors of these components for sale by both official and 3rd party retailers. These models are typically only marginally different, and the core functionality of different models should remain the same. Although this set up should work with most components, we can only guarantee functionality using
the parts listed here.
