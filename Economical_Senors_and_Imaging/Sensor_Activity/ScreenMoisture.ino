Circuit 4B - Temperature Sensor

The LCD will display readings from a temperature sensor in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.

This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community.
This code is completely free for any use.

  //convert the voltage to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit

  lcd.setCursor(0,0);                       //set the cursor to the top left position
  lcd.print("Moisture: ");                 //print a label for the data
  lcd.print(moisture);                      //print the degrees Celsius
  

  
  delay(1000);                              //delay for 1 second between each reading (this makes the display less noisy)
