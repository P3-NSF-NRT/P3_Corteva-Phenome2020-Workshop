#Camera Activity

This section compiles all of the necessary resources to recreate the RaspberryPi Camera demonstrations 
demonstrations at the Phenome 2020 Conference by Corteva.

## Hardware
Listed below are the RaspberryPiCamera used for our demonstration. There are many different models/flavors of these components for sale by both official and 3rd party retailers. These models are typically only marginally different, and the core functionality of different models should remain the same. Although this set up should work with most components, we can only guarantee functionality using
the parts listed here.

+ CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 Kit (https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi)
+ Arducam Low Light Sensor (https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-m12-night-vision-ir-cut-raspberry-pi-camera/)

## Software
To set up your RaspberryPi, follow the instructions at the following links
+ Installing NOOBS to RaspberryPi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md)
+ Python is natively supported by the RaspberryPi OS, and can be run from the command line.  

## Code
Code is provided for the following;
+ Python3 scripts to use the RaspberryPi camera. For the demonstration, commands were issued remotely via ssh.
+ A jupyter notebok demonstrating a possible image processing workflow. The jupyter notebook relies on the Python module "PlantCV" (https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/)
