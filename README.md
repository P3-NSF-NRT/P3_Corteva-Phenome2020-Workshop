# What is the Predictive Plant Phenomics Program?

The Predictive Plant Phenomics (P3) Program is an NSF NRT at Iowa State University (ISU) that brings together students with diverse backgrounds, including plant sciences, data sciences, and engineering, and provide them with data-enabled science and engineering training. 

Our P3 specialization has provided trainees access resources such as our "Plant Cy-nce" Boxes ([P3 Cy-nce Box article](https://www.research.iastate.edu/news/p3-program-introducing-new-technology-teamwork-to-the-classroom/)) and professional development experiences including this Corteva Agriscience Plant Science Syposium Series sponsered graduate student led workshop and symposium at [Phenome2020](https://phenome2020.org/).

# Predictive Plant Phenomics Graduate Student Phenotyping Sensors Workshop at Phenome2020

## Tuesday, February 25th from 7:00 pm - 8:00 pm

This workshop will introduce attendees to various, ready-to-use sensors that can be used for collecting phenotypic data of potted plants. This activity will be led by graduate students from Iowa State Universityâ€™s Predictive Plant Phenomics (P3) NSF NRT program and is sponsored by Corteva Agriscience. There will be an emphasis on hands-on building and experimenting with these economical sensors.
